This has been generated by the StormCrawler Maven Archetype as a starting point for building your own crawler.
Have a look at the code and resources and modify them to your heart's content. 

With Storm installed, you must first generate an uberjar:

``` sh
mvn clean package
```

before submitting the topology using the storm command:

``` sh
storm local target/webCrawler-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar --local-ttl 60 com.webcrawler.crawler.CrawlTopology -- -conf crawler-conf.yaml
```

This will run the topology in local mode for 60 seconds. Simply use the 'storm jar' to start the topology in distributed mode, where it will run indefinitely.

You can also use Flux to do the same:

``` sh
storm local target/webCrawler-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar  org.apache.storm.flux.Flux crawler.flux --local-ttl 3600
```

Note that in local mode, Flux uses a default TTL for the topology of 20 secs. The command above runs the topology for 1 hour.

It is best to run the topology with `storm jar` to benefit from the Storm UI and logging. In that case, the topology runs continuously, as intended.
